Student Management System

Project Overview:
                  Console-based Student Management System (SMS) that allows users to manage student records using Core Java 
and Java 8 Features. The project should support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) without using a database.
Features:
        Add new students with details like ID, Name, Age, Grade, and Email.
        View all students.
        Search for a student by ID.
        Update student details.
        Delete a student record.
        Store and retrieve student records from a file (without using a database).
        Sort students based on their Grade .
Technology Used:
                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Create a Student class.
                Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.) for storing student records.
                Exception Handling for invalid inputs.
                File Handling for storing and retrieving data.
                Streams & Lambda Expressions for filtering and sorting students.
                Method References for clean code.
                Optional Class to avoid NullPointerException.
                Functional Interfaces for flexible operations.
